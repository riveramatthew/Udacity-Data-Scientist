# Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 Analysis

## Motivation
This project analyzes the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to answer key questions about the developer job market:
1. What factors most influence developer compensation?
2. How widespread is AI adoption among developers?
3. Does remote work affect compensation levels?
4. How does experience level impact career outcomes?

The analysis helps both developers and employers understand current market trends.
